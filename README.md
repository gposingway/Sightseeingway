## Description

**Sightseeingway** is a Dalamud addon for Final Fantasy XIV designed to enhance your screenshot organization.  It automatically renames your saved screenshots to include valuable information directly in the filename:

  * **Character Name:**  Know exactly which character took the screenshot.
  * **Map Name:**  Quickly identify the in-game zone where the screenshot was taken.
  * **Coordinates (X, Y):** Pinpoint the exact location on the map.

This addon is perfect for:

  * **Gpose Enthusiasts:**  Easily catalog your scenic gpose locations.
  * **Screenshot Collectors:**  Organize your growing collection of FFXIV memories.
  * **Location Recall:**  Quickly find that amazing vista you screenshotted weeks ago\!

No more generic screenshot names like `ffxiv_001.png`\!  Sightseeingway helps you keep your FFXIV screenshot library organized and meaningful.

## Features

  * **Automatic Screenshot Renaming:** Renames screenshots immediately upon saving.
  * **Customizable Filename Format:** Allows users to customize the order and elements included in the filename.
  * **Lightweight and Easy to Use:** Simple drop-in addon with no complex configurations.

## Installation

1.  Make sure you have [Dalamud](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://goatcorp.github.io/dalamud/) installed.
2.  Open the Dalamud plugin installer within FFXIV (usually by typing `/xlplugins` in chat).
3.  Search for `Sightseeingway` in the plugin list.
4.  Click "Install".

## How to Use

Sightseeingway works automatically in the background\!  Simply take screenshots as you normally would in FFXIV.  When you save a screenshot, Sightseeingway will automatically rename it with the following format:

`[Timestamp]_[CharacterName]_[MapName]_[X-Coordinate][Y-Coordinate].png`

**Example:**

`20250101120000000-MyCharacter_TheWakingSands_X12_Y34.png`

This screenshot was taken by the character "MyCharacter" in "The Waking Sands" at coordinates X:12, Y:34.

## Planned Features (Future Development)

  * **Customizable Filename Format:** Allow users to choose which elements to include in the filename and customize the order (e.g., date, time, etc.).
  * **Option to include Region Name:** Add the region name (e.g., Thanalan) to the filename for even more location context.
  * **Settings Panel:**  Create a Dalamud settings panel for configuration options.
